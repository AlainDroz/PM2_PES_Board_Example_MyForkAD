# DC Motor

A direct current (DC) motor is a type of electric machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. DC motors take electrical power through direct current, and convert this energy into mechanical rotation transmisioned by the electric field. DC motors use magnetic fields that occur from the electrical currents generated, which powers the movement of a rotor fixed within the output shaft. The output torque and speed depends upon both the electrical input and the design of the motor.

## Static Characteristics of the 78:1 Metal Gearmotor 20Dx43L mm 12V CB

<center><img src="../images/dc_motor_static_characteristics.png" alt="Static Characteristics of 78: DC Motor" width="700"/></center>
<center> <i>Approximate static characteristics of 78:1 DC Motor</i> </center>

- These characteristics are approximations, and actual motors models may exhibit variations. It is advisable to make judicious choices in selecting motors, incorporating safety margins to account for these inaccuracies and avoid operating the motor at its extreme parameters. The top-left graph demonstrates the correlation between increasing torque and amperage, while the graph on the right illustrates the relationship between increasing speed and voltage. The subsequent graphs integrate these characteristics, revealing the interplay between torque and speed, aiding in motor selection. Additionally, the bottom-right graph highlights that the maximum power is generated within a specific range of speed and torque.
- The selection of different gear ratios significantly influences the capabilities of the engine. While the voltage and amperage ranges remain constant, adjustments in gear ratios impact torque and speed values. Opting for a larger gear ratio like 31:1 yields higher speeds at the expense of reduced available torque. Conversely, a lower gear ratio, such as 488:1, results in a comparatively lower maximum speed but offers significantly higher torque.
- During the design process, leveraging the presented characteristics proves beneficial for the appropriate motor selection. When aiming for high speeds, emphasizing the speed-voltage relationship is crucial, while lifting heavy objects places greater importance on torque characteristics. Ultimately, a judicious compromise can be achieved by considering the torque-speed relationship, enabling the optimal matching of the motor to the specific design requirements.

## Encoder and relative positioning
- A magnetic encoder is a sensor device that utilizes magnets and sensors to measure the position of a rotating object. It typically consists of a magnetically encoded disk attached to the rotating part and a sensor that detects changes in the magnetic field, converting them into electrical signals. It provides information about the rotational position of the object.
- It's important to note that magnetic encoders typically provide relative position information. This means that the encoder only gives data about changes in position relative to a specific reference point, and the initial position upon power-up or system initialization is considered as the zero reference point. Therefore, the accuracy of the measurements relies on the consistency of this reference, and any absolute positioning requires additional measures or sensors.

## Practical Tips

- To alter the motor's movement direction, adjust the power supply connection to the M1 and M2 outputs accordingly, and do the same for the encoder using the outA and outB outputs. It's crucial to note that the speed controller functions accurately when the encoder readings align with the motor's rotation direction. To ensure proper operation, establish the positive direction first, then connect the components to ensure both the direction and encoder readings are positive.
## DC motor driver

The ``DCMotor`` class is a versatile tool designed for controlling the velocity and rotation of a DC motor with precision. It incorporates essential components like an EncoderCounter, FastPWM, Motion control, PID controller, and an IIR Filter to ensure accurate control. This class provides user-friendly methods for adjusting velocity, rotation, control gains, and obtaining the current state of the motor, offering a comprehensive set of functionalities for effective motor control for the Pololu Metal Gearmotor family.

To start working with the DC motor, it is necessary to plug it correctly and create an object in the ``main`` file to assign DC motor output and encoder pins.

### Connection to the PES-Board
---------------------------
DC motors have assigned pins on the PES board, and since they are equipped with encoders, the pins assigned to them are also defined as follows:

```
// PES-Board Pin Names
PB_PWM_M1
PB_PWM_M2
PB_PWM_M3

PB_M1_ENC_A
PB_M1_ENC_B
PB_M2_ENC_A
PB_M2_ENC_B
PB_M3_ENC_A
PB_M3_ENC_B

PB_ENABLE_DCMOTORS
```

On the DC motor's encoder you can find following pins with description. Pins M1 and M2 function as PWM pins, commanding the power electronics on the PES Board which then applies voltage on the DC Motors. VCC and GND pins provide power to the encoder, while pins A and B are utilized to receive signals from the encoder.

### Enabling power electronics
---------------------------
The microcontroller commands DC motors through external power electronics, specifically an H-bridge for motor control. To interface and manage this external circuit, the microcontroller must be configured by setting up GPIO pins, timers, and PWM, the latter being crucial for adjusting the rotational speed of the motors.
<details Closed>
<summary><b>H-bridge and PWM</b></summary>

><center><img src="../images/hbridge_switches.png" alt="H-bridge" width="700"/></center>
> An H-bridge is a configuration of four switches that enables precise control over the direction and speed of a motor. These switches, typically transistors or MOSFETs arranged in the shape of an "H," determine the current flow through the motor. By selectively activating different pairs of switches, the H-bridge can drive the motor forward, backward, or apply braking. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is often employed for speed control, allowing the regulation of motor speed by adjusting the ON and OFF times of the switches. 

><center><img src="../images/pwm.png" alt="PWM" width="700"/></center>
>Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) in DC motor control involves varying the duty cycle of a rapidly switching signal to regulate the average voltage reaching the motor. By adjusting the duty cycle, the speed of the motor can be finely controlled, with higher duty cycles resulting in increased speed and vice versa. This dynamic control is achieved by applying PWM to the H-bridge, allowing bidirectional current flow through the motor for forward, reverse, and braking actions.

To power the DC motors, connect a 12V external power source, formed by combining two 6V battery packs, to the back of the PES board. If using a 6V power supply, connect one set of pins and bridge the remaining two. Turn on the PES board using the ON/OFF slider. After turning on the power, enable the external power electronics, represented by an H-bridge, by creating a DigitalOut object with a PIN argument that enables the motors. This object should be created alongside other DC motor objects.
```
DigitalOut enable_motors(PB_ENABLE_DCMOTORS); // create DigitalOut object to enable dc motors
```
To complete the motor activation process, set the value of the object to 1, enabling the use and control of the motors by utilizing battery power. Place this statement after the trigger statement to ensure it is executed in the foreground and not running in the background without purpose.
```
// enable hardwaredriver dc motors: 0 -> disabled, 1 -> enabled
enable_motors = 1;
```

### Create and command DC motor objects
---------------------------
The motors can be used in different way and the following example provides all type of usage:
- [Motor M1](#motor-m1) is used open-loop,
- [Motor M2](#motor-m2) is used closed-loop to command velocity (rotations per second),
- [Motor M3](#motor-m3) is used closed-loop to command position (rotations).

In the example provided for the purpose of explaining the differences in controll of DC motors, we assume that we have three DC motors and encoders that are plugged into pins M1 - M3 on the PES-Board.

<!-- TODO: Change the example below, and add a bullet point list afterwards with a description.
In general the dcmotor harddware description needs some love! Maybe think about creating WS3 first and then based on this finalise the hardware description. -->
#### Motor M1
To use Motor M1 in open loop, start by adding the appropriate driver to the ``main`` file. Next, create an object by passing the pin names as arguments; these should only be PWM pins since Motor M1 is controlled in open loop. Additionally, define a DigitalOut object to enable the DC motor.
```
#include "pm2_drivers/FastPWM/FastPWM.h"

...

DigitalOut enable_motors(PB_ENABLE_DCMOTORS); // create DigitalOut object to enable dc motors
```
Then the FastPWM object needs to be created, which is used to command DC motor:
```
//Motor M1
FastPWM pwm_M1(PB_PWM_M1);                    // create FastPWM object to command motor M1
```
Motor M1 is controlled using PWM to determine its speed and direction of rotation. Since this motor doesn't involve motion control with an encoder, the set speed is achieved by specifying a value between 0 and 1. A value of 0.5 corresponds to the motor being stationary, below 0.5 causes the motor to rotate in one direction, and above 0.5 makes it rotate in the opposite direction.

```
pwm_M1.write(0.75f)
```

#### Motor M2
Motor M2 operates in a closed loop to control velocity. To utilize it, it's necessary to include the appropriate driver in our ``main`` file. Then, create an object with the PWM pins, as well as the A and B pins associated with the encoder. Additionally, define a DigitalOut object to enable the DC motor. 
```
#include "pm2_drivers/EncoderCounter.h" 
#include "pm2_drivers/DCMotor.h"        

...

DigitalOut enable_motors(PB_ENABLE_DCMOTORS); // create DigitalOut object to enable dc motors
```
When declaring a DC motor object for closed-loop control, it is essential to specify several arguments related to motor parameters, including gear ratio, motor constant, and the maximum available voltage based on the number of battery packs. The following code illustrates the declaration of all necessary parameters to command this motor:

```
const float voltage_max = 12.0f;     // maximum voltage of battery packs, adjust this to 
                                     // 6.0f V if you only use one batterypack

//Motor M2
// https://www.pololu.com/product/3485/specs
const float gear_ratio_M2 = 78.125f;                       // 78.125:1 gear box
const float kn_M2 = 180.0f / 12.0f;                        // motor constant in RPM / V
DCMotor motor_M2(PB_PWM_M2, PB_ENC_A_M2, PB_ENC_B_M2, gear_ratio_M2, kn_M2, voltage_max);
```
Crucially, the default motor driver does not employ a motion planner, meaning the declared speed will be reached as quickly as possible. To test this, you can place the following command inside a while loop.

**Note:** The maximum velocity is calculated and set in the driver based on these input arguments.

```
motor_M2.setVelocity(motor_M2.getMaxVelocity());
```
Nevertheless, the driver is designed to facilitate smooth movements, incorporating features like gradual acceleration. The process adheres to the outlined diagram, wherein the motion planner defines trajectories. Subsequently, feedback from the motor (leveraging encoders) is obtained, and the speed controller governs the motor's movement.

<center><img src="../images/dc_motor_vel_cntrl.png" alt="DC Motor Velocity Control" width="900"/></center>
<center> <i>DC Motor Velocity Control Block Diagram</i> </center>

To use the motion planner motion planner needs to be activated with the following command, that is placed below motor declaration:
```
motor_M2.setEnableMotionPlanner(true);
```
If there is no command to set the speed inside the while loop, add one and run the program.
```
motor_M2.setVelocity(motor_M2.getMaxVelocity());
```
<!-- TODO - CHCECK IT OUT Below are graphs of velocity and acceleration versus time. As you can see on the left side where the planner was not used the acceleration of the motor is more abrupt as shown in the acceleration graphs, there is also some overdrive of speed, which means a jump in speed over the target value. In the second case on the right, the acceleration is smoother (longer in time), as can be seen in the acceleration graph, as well as in the speed graph where the value without overdrive reaches the target value.

<center><img src="../images/acc_vel_graphs.png" alt="DC Motor acceleration and velocity with and without planner" width="900"/></center>
<center> <i>DC Motor acceleration and velocity with and without planner</i> </center> -->

Adjustments to the maximum acceleration or maximum speed values can be made by using the following commands, which should be placed after declaring the motor.
```
motor_M2.setMaxVelocity(motor_M2.getMaxVelocity() * 0.5f);
motor_M2.setMaxAcceleration(motor_M2.getMaxAcceleration() * 0.5f);
```

#### Motor M3
To utilize Motor M3 in closed loop for position control, similar to the previous example, it is crucial to include the appropriate driver in the main file and create an object with the pin's name passed as an argument. These include the PWM pins, as well as the A and B pins associated with the encoder. Additionally, a DigitalOut object should be defined to enable the DC motor.

```
#include "pm2_drivers/EncoderCounter.h" 
#include "pm2_drivers/DCMotor.h"        

...

DigitalOut enable_motors(PB_ENABLE_DCMOTORS); // create DigitalOut object to enable dc motors
```
When defining a DC motor object intended for closed-loop control, certain parameters related to motor characteristics (such as gear ratio and motor constant) must be specified. Additionally, the maximum available voltage needs to be defined based on the number of battery packs in use. The code snippet below illustrates how to declare these essential parameters for commanding the motor:

```
const float voltage_max = 12.0f;     // maximum voltage of battery packs, adjust this to 
                                     // 6.0f V if you only use one batterypack

//Motor M3
// https://www.pololu.com/product/3477/specs
const float gear_ratio_M3 = 78.125f;                       // 78.125:1 gear box
const float kn_M3 = 180.0f / 12.0f;                        // motor constant in RPM / V
DCMotor motor_M3(PB_PWM_M3, PB_ENC_A_M3, PB_ENC_B_M3, gear_ratio_M3, kn_M3, voltage_max);
```
It's crucial to note that the default driver controlling the motor does not utilize a motion planner, causing the declared position to be reached as quickly as possible. To observe this, you can experiment by incorporating the following command within a while loop.

**Note:** The argument passed represents the value in units of rotations.

```
motor_M3.setRotation(10.0f);
```
Nevertheless, the driver is engineered to facilitate smooth movements, including gradual acceleration. The process adheres to the illustrated diagram, wherein the motion planner establishes trajectories for the position. Subsequently, it receives position feedback from the motor (utilizing encoders for this purpose). The discrepancy is then forwarded, along with velocity feedback, to the speed controller, governing the motor's movement.

To use the motion planner motion planner needs to be activated with the following command, that is placed below motor declaration:
```
motor_M3.setEnableMotionPlanner(true);
```
If there is no command to set the speed inside the while loop, add one and run the program.
```
motor_M3.setPosition(10.0f);
```

Adjustments to the maximum acceleration or maximum speed values can be made by using the following commands, which should be placed after declaring the motor.
```
motor_M3.setMaxVelocity(motor_M3.getMaxVelocity() * 0.5f);
motor_M3.setMaxAcceleration(motor_M3.getMaxAcceleration() * 0.5f);
```
