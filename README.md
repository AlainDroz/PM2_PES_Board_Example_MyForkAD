## Course setup

In order to be able to complete the course, one must first register on the following platforms and obtain the appropriate tools. All the information needed to start the course can be found [here](docs/markdown/general_info.md). The file covers all the information about: 

- [<font size="3"> Accounts </font>](docs/markdown/general_info.md#accounts)
- [<font size="3">Software </font>](docs/markdown/general_info.md#software)
- [<font size="3">GitHub </font>](docs/markdown/general_info.md#github)
- [<font size="3">Arm MBed </font>](docs/markdown/general_info.md#arm-mbed)
  
## Hardware

In our course, we'll be utilizing the Nucleo-F446RE microcontroller, which is used in combination with the PES board designed and developed at ZHAW. The basic hardwarekid includes a variety of sensors and actuators for practical applications.

### Nucleo F446RE
------------------------
The Nucleo-F446RE is a microcontroller development board featuring the STM32F446RET6 microcontroller from STMicroelectronics. It provides a versatile platform for prototyping and developing embedded systems, offering a wide range of peripherals, connectivity options, and compatibility with the Arduino and ST Morpho ecosystems. All of the technical details can be found here: [STM32F446RE Documentation][2]

<!-- TODO: Please write this sentence nicer -->
Arm MBed has prepared a special platform containing key information on the controller used. On it you can find technical information, but most importantly the pinmap of outputs, which is necessary for the correct connection of peripheral devices.

### PES Board
------------------------
The PES Board is a hardware board created to work with the Nucleo F446RE on which appropriate outputs and inputs are designed to allow a more orderly connection of peripheral devices. It provides multiple pinouts for:

- 3 DC-Motor (brushed)
- 4 Servos (these occupy the 4 DI/O if used)
- 4 DI/O, 3.3V (5V tolerant)
- 4 AI/O, 3.3V (5V tolerant)
- 3 Encoder-Counter
- 9-axis IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer)

><b>Important information related to the PES Board</b>
>- <b>Using the PES-Board with power On and hardware running while connected to your computer/laptop happens at your own risk. There was a case where the students laptop was damaged in the past.</b>
>- <b>Under now circumstances leave the battery charger connected to the PES-Board when using the PES-Board or having it connected to your computer.</b>
>- <b>Motor encoder soldering can be wrong. Do not assume that if you plug in one motor and everything works you can the also use the same connections with an other motor and everything works. You have to make sure that the physical rotation is according to your assumption and that a positive input leads to a positive change of increments.</b>
>- <b>Depending on the PES BOARD version DCMotor M3 rotation direction might be inverted.</b>
<!-- >- <b>Depending on the PES BOARD version the Pin map might differ</b> -->

</br>

The kit includes two sets of 6V battery packs, which can be connected parallel provide 12V voltage. If you are using a single battery pack, the remaining pins should be bridged.

The batteries enables the board to function independently of the computer, eliminating the need for a connection via the Mini USB cable. Despite this, the board continues to receive a stable 5V supply while offering the option to use a 12V supply for the motors. To activate the external battery power, switch the slider on the PES board to the ON position.
